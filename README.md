## IDEA or PROBLEM STATEMENT
In today's world with people who have such comtemplative thoughts that can influence others, there shouldn't be a barrier to share that with the world. With the vast reach of the internet it has become possible to see and reflect or react on these thoughts. Micro-blogging is an online broadcast medium that has become popular in the 21st Century. Like its name suggests the media broadcasted is small in size literally and in terms of aggregated file size.
Our idea KIBITZ a micro-blogging application is a medium for these expressions to reach a group of people. Anyone with a kibitz_ID can blog, share picture and videos and comment, like and encourage others to do so too. It also has an instant messaging facility where one can personally connect to a fellow Kibitz-ite to bring people closer. 
The softwares used to bring this idea to life are Figma and Android Studio. Figma was used for the initial prototype i.e. the UI design and the various connections between them to understand the various layers of the application. Then, Android Studio was used to develop the application. At present it has the user interface and can navigate between various activities(pages) of the application. The backend development remains.

### Write-up on the approach taken for UI design* (required)
---
The UI design was made with the following components in mind:
1. Security of the user- Only a person with a Kibitz-ID can be a part of the network. A login and sign-up page was designed for this purpose. There is also a page reserved to explain the intensions of this application and the rules for the users using it so that nobody is harmed.

2. Blogging- The user can type his or her thoughts and also add pictures and videos these can be broadcasted and shared in the application. A blogging facility and a page for media addition is used for this purpose.

3. Connecting with people- Instant messaging and user profiles were created for this purpose so that the users of this application can get to know other Kibitz-ites to relate to them and get to know them. There is a chatting forum and a public profile page for a user visible to all other users which is maintained by the user.

4. Liking, commenting and sharing- To encourage the Kibitz-ites these features are also present. There is a pop-up to comment and a page created to view the comments. There is also a page reserved for sharing to ensure simplicity and so that the application is not over-crowded. Functions like liking can be easily accessed with a simple touch/click of the symbol on a post

5. A consolidated homepage- That is simple and at the same time allows user to access all of the above mentioned activities
The application is focussed on the utility more than the extravagance and hence has a uniform colouring and appealing interface.
